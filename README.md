# E-Commerce Application - Follow-Along Project

This is a mentor-guided project where we build a full-fledged E-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The application will include features like user authentication, product management, and order handling.
## Milestone 1: Project Overview

In this milestone, we:
- Understood the overall structure of a MERN project.
- Learned the foundational steps of setting up a new project.
- Explored key functionalities of an e-commerce application, such as:
  - User Authentication: Secure login and registration.
  - Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
  - Order Handling: Manage customer orders.
- Discussed REST API structure and endpoints for handling backend tasks.
- Gained clarity on database schema design using MongoDB.

This milestone focused on preparing the foundation for upcoming project stages by setting up the repository and understanding the application's goals and features.
