ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Application - Follow-Along Project
This is a mentor-guided project where we build a full-fledged E-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).
The application includes features like user authentication, product management, and order handling.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **File Uploads**: Multer
- **Development Tools**: Git, GitHub, Postman

---

### Milestone 1: Project Overview
- Understood the MERN project structure and key functionalities.
- Explored core e-commerce features:
  - User Authentication (Login & Registration)
  - Product Management (Add, update, and retrieve products)
  - Order Handling (Manage customer orders)
- Discussed REST API structure and MongoDB schema design.
- Set up the GitHub repository and planned the project workflow.

### Milestone 2: Frontend & Backend Setup
- **Project Structure**: Organized frontend and backend into separate directories.
  - **Frontend**:
    - Created a React app and configured Tailwind CSS.
    - Built the Login Page with user authentication.
  - **Backend**:
    - Set up a Node.js server using Express.
    - Connected the backend to MongoDB.
- **Progress**: The first user-facing feature (Login Page) is complete! âœ…

### Milestone 3: Backend Development & Database Connection
- Implemented a structured backend with:
  - Routes
  - Controllers
  - Models
  - Middleware
- Configured the Node.js server to handle API requests.
- Connected MongoDB for efficient data storage.
- Added basic error handling to improve debugging & user experience.

### Milestone 4: E-Commerce App - User Management & File Uploads ðŸš€
- Introduced user management and file uploads in the backend.
  - Created a User Model using MongoDB schemas to structure user data.
  - Implemented a User Controller to handle user-related requests like registration and retrieval.
  - Configured Multer for file uploads, allowing users to store images on the server.
- The project repository was updated with these features and documented in the README.

### Milestone 5: Creating the Signup Page
- **Frontend UI**: Built the Sign-Up page where users can register by providing their details, including:
  - Full Name
  - Email
  - Password
- **Form Validation**: Ensured the form validates input data, checking:
  - Proper email format.
  - Password length and strength.
  - Confirmation of matching passwords.
- The Signup page includes proper validation to ensure clean and valid data is submitted.
- **Next Steps**: In the following milestone, we will connect the frontend with the backend and implement user sessions.
