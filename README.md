# E-Commerce Application - Follow-Along Project

This is a mentor-guided project where we build a full-fledged E-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The application will include features like user authentication, product management, and order handling.
## Milestone 1: Project Overview

In this milestone, we:
- Understood the overall structure of a MERN project.
- Learned the foundational steps of setting up a new project.
- Explored key functionalities of an e-commerce application, such as:
  - User Authentication: Secure login and registration.
  - Product Management: Add, update, and retrieve product data.
  - Order Handling: Manage customer orders.
- Discussed REST API structure and endpoints for handling backend tasks.
- Gained clarity on database schema design using MongoDB.

This milestone focused on preparing the foundation for upcoming project stages by setting up the repository and understanding the application's goals and features.

# E-Commerce App - Milestone 2 ðŸš€  
This milestone sets up the frontend with React and Tailwind CSS, and the backend with Node.js.  
The project follows a structured folder hierarchy with separate frontend and backend directories.  
The first user-facing feature, the Login Page, has been built with functionality and styling.  
Check the repository for the complete setup and progress!  

# E-Commerce App - Milestone 3 ðŸš€  
This milestone establishes the backend using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.  
A structured folder hierarchy is implemented with routes, controllers, models, and middleware.  
The server is configured to handle API requests and connect to MongoDB for data storage.  
Basic error handling is added to improve debugging and user experience.

# E-Commerce App - Milestone 4 ðŸš€  
This milestone introduces user management and file uploads in the backend.  
A **User Model** is created using MongoDB schemas to structure user data.  
A **User Controller** is implemented to handle user-related requests like registration and retrieval.  
Multer is configured to enable file uploads, allowing users to store images on the server.
