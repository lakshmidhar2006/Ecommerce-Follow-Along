# ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Application - Follow-Along Project

This is a mentor-guided project where we build a full-fledged E-commerce application using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).  
The application includes features like **user authentication, product management, and order handling**.

---

##  Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **File Uploads**: Multer
- **Development Tools**: Git, GitHub, Postman

---

##  Milestone 1: Project Overview
- Understood the **MERN project structure** and key functionalities.
- Explored **core e-commerce features**:  
  -  **User Authentication** (Login & Registration)  
  -  **Product Management** (Add, update, and retrieve products)  
  -  **Order Handling** (Manage customer orders)
- Discussed **REST API structure** and MongoDB schema design.
- Set up the **GitHub repository** and planned the project workflow.

##  Milestone 2: Frontend & Backend Setup
- **Project Structure:** Organized frontend and backend into separate directories.
- **Frontend:**
  - Created a **React app** and configured **Tailwind CSS**.
  - Built the **Login Page** with user authentication.
- **Backend:**
  - Set up a **Node.js server** using Express.
  - Connected the backend to MongoDB.
- **Progress:** The first user-facing feature (Login Page) is complete! âœ…

##  Milestone 3: Backend Development & Database Connection
- Implemented a **structured backend** with:
  -  Routes
  -  Controllers
  -  Models
  -  Middleware
- Configured the **Node.js server** to handle API requests.
- Connected **MongoDB** for efficient data storage.
- Added **basic error handling** to improve debugging & user experience.

# E-Commerce App - Milestone 4 ðŸš€  
This milestone introduces user management and file uploads in the backend.  
A **User Model** is created using MongoDB schemas to structure user data.  
A **User Controller** is implemented to handle user-related requests like registration and retrieval.  
Multer is configured to enable file uploads, allowing users to store images on the server.  
The project repository is updated with these features and documented in the README.
